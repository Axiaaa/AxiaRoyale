# NostalgiaRoyale 
NostalgiaRoyale is in developpement.
The goal of this server is to provide an entire solo experience of the old ClashRoyale. You might be able to play with your friend with
softwares like Hamachi, but you'll have to manipulate the APK. It also need a mySQL database. A guide will be writed soon.

## Working on :

Chests in slots (need to implement logic)




## Things that are implemented :

- Leaderboard Rank on profile
- Possibility to manipulate trainer deck (random and level)
- There's more commands 

# APK Link
OUTDATED ! ~~https://www.mediafire.com/file/f4fz9p90o4x3r9i/CR_Axia_compiled_%25281%2529_compiled.apk/file~~

For a better experience, I recommend you to download the custom APK. It does change some things, but it really doesn't change the core of the game.

#### Site note : 
I'm not very good at coding, so please don't mind if some parts aren't optimized or doesn't really work. 
You can of course open an issue (i'll try to fix lol) or a pull request ! :)
